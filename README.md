## An Art Trading Platform with a Dual Mechanism of Direct Purchase and Blind Boxes

Today's shopping websites suffer from a high degree of homogenization, lacking unique highlights and the potential to stand out from the multitude of websites. As
material resources and wealth become increasingly abundant, many people may not only seek to satisfy their material needs from shopping websites but also crave
novelty and excitement driven by randomness.
Furthermore, the art market has always been characterized by the difficulty of assessing value, which has resulted in limited opportunities for ordinary artists to market
their work effectively. Therefore, finding a way to bridge these two aspects could lead to business opportunities and industry breakthroughs.
Hence, I want to develop an art trading platform that offers a unique blend of traditional purchasing and an exciting blind box mechanism. This platform will
predominantly feature a diverse range of works by ordinary artists. Users will have the flexibility to either purchase specific artworks directly or opt for the thrill of the
unknown with our blind boxes. These blind boxes, available at various price points across different art categories, will contain artworks whose identity remains a
surprise until they are opened. This innovative approach aims to encourage users to discover and appreciate art styles and artists that they might not typically explore,
enriching their buying experience. Our platform is designed to cater to a wide audience, including art enthusiasts, casual buyers, emerging artists, collectors, and
investors.
From a technical standpoint, the website will implement a modular design using frontend and backend separation. Use PHP for the front end. The backend will use
Spring Boot in combination with SQL databases and, in the end, will be containerized using Docker for ease of mobility and deployment.
